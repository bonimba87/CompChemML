# CompChemML
Portfolio of mini-projects for upskilling in ML applied to Cheminformatics and Computational Chemistry

1. **Phase 1: Foundational ML methods applied to QSAR problems**
a. Prediction of aqueous solubility of small molecules (regression)
b. Classification of toxicity v non toxicity of small molecules (classification) wrt different assays

2. **Phase 2: Introduce Graph Neural Networks**
(ongoing)
